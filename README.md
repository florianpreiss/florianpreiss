**Applied AI Engineer · Production ML & GenAI Systems · AWS**

Hi there, I’m Florian 👋 

I currently work as a **Data Scientist @ Audi Business Innovation**, where I design and deploy **ML + LLM-based architectures** (RAG, multi-agent workflows) on **AWS** and take projects from scoping to rollout with stakeholders.

## How I Work

I approach projects with a **user-centric and product-oriented mindset**:

- Start with the user workflow and decision context  
- Translate business problems into ML objectives (SMART)
- Iterate in agile cycles with continuous validation  
- Balance technical depth with clarity for stakeholders  

My experience spans technical architecture, stakeholder alignment, and presenting complex AI systems to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Beyond Work

Sport shapes how I think: long-term consistency, structured training, iterative improvement.  
The same principles guide how I build ML systems.
